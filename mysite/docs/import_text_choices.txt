Importing Text Choices
======================

In my full app I managed to use django-import-export to pull in 45-thousand
records, but one field, which is a text choice, imported with the full value
instead of the code, so the later filter did not recognize the codes.

After some searching online, I didn't find a decent solution to this problem
(or, most likely, I don't know how to ask Duck Duck Go the question).

So this app tests importing a field that uses a text choice.

In `models.py`::

    from django.db import models
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


    class Status(models.TextChoices):
        NEW = "NEW", _("New")
        CONTINUED = "CNT", _("Continued")
        REMOVED = "RMV", _("Removed")


    class Territory(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField("Name", max_length=64)
        status = models.CharField(
            "Status", max_length=3, choices=Status.choices, default=Status.NEW
        )

        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.name}|{self.status}"

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"<Territory {self.name}>"

and in `resources.py`::

    from import_export import resources

    from .models import Territory


    class TerritoryResource(resources.ModelResource):
        class Meta:
            model = Territory
            skip_unchanged = True
            fields = ("id", "name", "status")

I wrote a test case to import a dataset and it broke, but not for the reasons 
I expected. For some reason I had to include a hard-coded id to the import.

From tests.py::

    from django.test import TestCase

    from import_text_choice.models import Territory, Status
    from import_text_choice.resources import TerritoryResource

    from tablib import Dataset


    class ImportTestCase(TestCase):
        def test_basic_import(self):
            """importing with the choice's verbose name should encode correctly"""
            data = ["1", "Joes", "Continued"]

            territories = TerritoryResource()
            dataset = Dataset(data, headers=["id", "name", "status"])
            territories.import_data(dataset, dry_run=False)
            res = Territory.objects.get(name="Joes")
            self.assertEqual(res.status, Status.CONTINUED)

This doesn't tie the text choices to the database. You can see the issue in
this commit (TBD).

From `this answer`_ on StackOverflow, the correct solution should be
to use a Foregn Key.
